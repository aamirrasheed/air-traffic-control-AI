# air-traffic-control-AI
An AI that plays an air traffic simulator, routing randomly spawned planes to their destinations while avoiding collisions with each other and environmental obstacles.

The game is `python-air-traffic-control`, a python implementation of the above scenario. You can find its original repo [here.](https://github.com/scotty3785/python-air-traffic-control). I'm playing it in the gif below.
